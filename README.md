# Nexus Virtual List
Nexus Virtual List is a utility for displaying long lists of frames
efficiently. This is done by only showing the frames that aren't being
clipped (+ a buffer for scrolling). Automatic scrolling is also supported
(such as global leaderboards or random item displays).

Nexus Virtual List is not tied to any framework, unlike
[`ElementList` in Nexus Plugin Components](https://github.com/TheNexusAvenger/Nexus-Plugin-Components/blob/master/docs/lists.md).

For use with React-Luau, consider [a Luau adaption of FlashList](https://github.com/Neura-Studios/flash-list-lua).

## Usage
Examples can be found in the [`demo` folder](./demo/).
